# Euclidean-Algorithm
Python script that calculates the greatest common divisor between two numbers based on the Euclidean Algorithm
The Euclidean Algorithm states that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r), where:
 a > b
 a and b are positive integers
 r = remainder of a and b (a = qb + r)
The algorithm computes until r = 0, resulting in gcd(b, 0)- which is simply b.
